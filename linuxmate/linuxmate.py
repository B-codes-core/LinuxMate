Environment variables are stored in the kernel and can be accessed by any process.\n\nCommonly used environment variables include:\n\n* `PATH`: Specifies the directories that the shell will search for executable files.\n* `HOME`: Specifies the home directory of the current user.\n* `USER`: Specifies the username of the current user.\n* `SHELL`: Specifies the shell that is currently running.\n\nEnvironment variables can be set or modified using the `export` command. For example, to set the `MY_VARIABLE` environment variable to the value \"hello\", you would use the following command:\n\n```\nexport MY_VARIABLE=hello\n```\n\nYou can view all of the currently set environment variables by using the `env` command.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the following resources:\n\n* [Environment Variables in Linux](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_05_01.html)\n* [How to Set and Use Environment Variables in Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-and-use-environment-variables-in-linux)\n\nI hope this helps!
